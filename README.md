Work on the use of fuzzy models for Image processing and time series prediction.
Just open Fuzzy_models.ipynb on Colab ands execute each line of code. To learn more about my work,
recent researches on fuzzy clustering and fuzzy deep-learning consult the following file
provided in the repository Fuzzy_and_Deep_Fuzzy_Logic.pdf .
