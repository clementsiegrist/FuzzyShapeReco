## Fuzzy and Deep-Fuzzy Logic for image clustering and time series processing

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/clementsiegrist/reco_formes/blob/main/Fuzzy_models.ipynb)

Work on the use of fuzzy models for Image processing and time series prediction.
Just open Fuzzy_models.ipynb on Colab ands execute each line of code. To learn more about my work,
recent researches on fuzzy clustering and fuzzy deep-learning consult the following file
provided in the repository Fuzzy_and_Deep_Fuzzy_Logic.pdf [here](https://github.com/clementsiegrist/reco_formes/blob/main/Fuzzy_and_Deep_Fuzzy_Logic.pdf)

## Outline 

**I. Brief visualization of some fuzzy membership functions**

**II. Fuzzy-Cmeans**

*II. A. Fuzzy-Cmeans on a greyscale image*
*II. B. Fuzzy-Cmeans on a RGB image*
*II. C. Fuzzy-CMeans with fcmeans library*

**III. ANFIS : Adaptative Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems**
